This program deals with building a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_c_e_l}{D\+C\+EL}} data strutcure to store any type of planar graph given in the input. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{How it works}}~\newline
 A simple overview of the construction of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_c_e_l}{D\+C\+EL}}\+: ~\newline
 Step 1\+: For each \mbox{\hyperlink{class_edge}{Edge}}, create two new Half\+Edges, assign their twins and put them in corresponding source/tail vertex lists ~\newline
 Step 2\+: Sort all the Half\+Edges present at each \mbox{\hyperlink{class_vertex}{Vertex}} in clockwise order ~\newline
 Step 3\+: For Every pair of Half\+Edges next to each other on a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_vertex}{Vertex}}, assign their next and prev pointers ~\newline
 Step 4\+: Taking each \mbox{\hyperlink{class_half_edge}{Half\+Edge}}, if its face points to nullptr, create new face and assign to all Half\+Edges which can be obtained by traversing the next pointer. Set the represntative of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_face}{Face}} object to any of theese halfedges and add this face to the list of Faces present in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_c_e_l}{D\+C\+EL}} ~\newline

 Steps to Compile and Run \+: ~\newline
 1) {\itshape cd} into the src directory ~\newline
 2) Run {\itshape g++ \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}}} which generates an executable called {\itshape a.\+out} in the same directory ~\newline
 3) Run the executable using {\itshape ./a.out} (on linux) ~\newline
 3.\+1) The executable takes a dataset from command line argument. For example, to use an existing dataset, run {\itshape ./a.out ../datasets/1sq.txt} ~\newline
 3.\+2) If no command-\/line argument is given, it takes input from the shell directly (stdin) ~\newline


~\newline
 Performance of the algorithm is documented in the report~\newline
\hypertarget{index_Input}{}\doxysubsection{Input}\label{index_Input}
Input is given as follows\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input can be given both from file (via command-\/line args) or stdin ~\newline

\item First line must contain the no of Edges to be taken as input by the program. ~\newline

\item Each of next line must contain 4 integers, space seperated denoting the (x1, y1), (x2, y2) coordinates of endpoints of each edge. ~\newline

\item Each coordinate must be of integer type in the range -\/10$^\wedge$8 to 10$^\wedge$8. ~\newline

\item Number of coordinates must be less than 1 Billion. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_Output}{}\doxysubsection{Output}\label{index_Output}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The program prints all the Faces, Edges, Half\+Edges which are incident and present in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_d_c_e_l}{D\+C\+EL}} structure to accurately show the representation of planar graph
