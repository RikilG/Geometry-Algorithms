This program deals with triangulation of polygons. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{How it works}}~\newline
 A simple overview of the triangulation process\+: ~\newline
 Step 1\+: Subdivide the input polygon into monotones by drawing diagonals in the polygon. ~\newline
 Step 2\+: For each monotone, perform Monotone triangulation which can be easily done. ~\newline
 Step 3\+: Combine the output of all monotone triangulations to get the final triangulation for the polygon ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The ear clipping algorithm is even more simpler, but is not efficient w.\+r.\+t time complexity\+: ~\newline
 Step 1\+: Find the \char`\"{}ear\char`\"{} of the polygon. which is the vertex whose internal angle is less than PI ~\newline
 Step 2\+: Check if any other Reflex \mbox{\hyperlink{class_vertex}{Vertex}} (whose internal angel is greater than PI) comes under the triangle to be formed. If so, then repeat Step 1 until a valid \char`\"{}ear\char`\"{} can be found. It is proved that there are always atleast 2 ears for any vertex hence, it is sure that we will find it. ~\newline
 Step 3\+: Triangulate this ear by drawing a diagonal on the adjacent vertices to this vertex, store this operation/triangle and remove the ear vertex from the polygon. loop from step 1 until we triangulate completely.~\newline

 Steps to Compile and Run \+: ~\newline
 1) {\itshape cd} into the src directory ~\newline
 2) Run {\itshape g++ \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}}} which generates an executable called {\itshape a.\+out} in the same directory ~\newline
 3) Run the executable using {\itshape ./a.out} (on linux) ~\newline
 3.\+1) The executable takes a dataset from command line argument. For example, to use an existing dataset, run {\itshape ./a.out ../datasets/1sq.txt} ~\newline
 3.\+2) If no command-\/line argument is given, it takes input from the shell directly (stdin) ~\newline


~\newline
 Performance of the algorithm is documented in the report~\newline
\hypertarget{index_Input}{}\doxysubsection{Input}\label{index_Input}
Input is given as follows\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input can be given both from file (via command-\/line args) or stdin ~\newline

\item Input {\bfseries{must}} contain the clockwise ordering of input vertices
\item First line must contain the no of Points to be taken as input by the program. ~\newline

\item Each of next line must contain 2 integers, space seperated denoting the (x, y) coordinates of each point. ~\newline

\item Each coordinate must be of integer type in the range -\/10$^\wedge$8 to 10$^\wedge$8. ~\newline

\item Number of coordinates must be less than 1 Billion. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_Output}{}\doxysubsection{Output}\label{index_Output}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The output contains the coordinates of all the triangles formed after triangulation of the polygon.~\newline
