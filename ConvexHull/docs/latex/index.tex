This algorithm deals with finding convex hull over the points given in the input. ~\newline
 {\bfseries{How it works}}~\newline
 A simple overview of the algorithm\+: ~\newline
 Step 1\+: Recursively compute the upper hull ~\newline
 Step 2\+: Recursively compute the lower hull ~\newline
 Step 3\+: Combine both the hulls and return the output ~\newline

 Steps to Compile and Run \+: ~\newline
 1) {\itshape cd} into the src directory ~\newline
 2) Run {\itshape g++ \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}}} which generates an executable called {\itshape a.\+out} in the same directory ~\newline
 3) Run the executable using {\itshape ./a.out} (on linux) ~\newline
 3.\+1) The executable takes a dataset from command line argument. For example, to use an existing dataset, run {\itshape ./a.out ../datasets/edge.txt} ~\newline
 3.\+2) If no command-\/line argument is given, it takes input from the shell directly (stdin) ~\newline


~\newline
 Performance of the algorithm is documented in the report~\newline
\hypertarget{index_Input}{}\doxysubsection{Input}\label{index_Input}
Input is given as follows\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input can be given both from file (via command-\/line args) or stdin ~\newline

\item First line must contain the no of Points to be taken as input by the program. ~\newline

\item Each of next line must contain 2 integers, space seperated denoting the (x, y) coordinates of each point. ~\newline

\item Each coordinate must be of integer type in the range -\/10$^\wedge$6 to 10$^\wedge$6. ~\newline

\item Number of coordinates must be less than 1 Billion. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_Output}{}\doxysubsection{Output}\label{index_Output}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each line of output gives the coordinates present on the convex hull in clockwise order
\end{DoxyItemize}
